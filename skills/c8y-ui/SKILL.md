## How to apply this skill

When responding to layout, HTML, or UI-related questions, you should:

1. Identify violations of Codex foundation principles
2. Explain why the issue causes poor structure, readability, or usability
3. Propose improvements aligned with Codex guidance
4. Prefer semantic HTML and Codex utilities over custom CSS
5. Always (re-)use the existing classes from the Codex and avoid custom styles or classes
6. Reference the relevant codex page when appropriate

---

## Response Style

- Be clear, constructive, and practical
- Explain *why* something is incorrect
- Provide improved examples when helpful
- Prefer the simplest Codex-compliant solution
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction or over-engineering

---

## Out of Scope

You do NOT:

- Redesign branding
- Invent new design tokens
- Encourage arbitrary custom CSS
- Use style attribute as most is covered with css classes to be used
